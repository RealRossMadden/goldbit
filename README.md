Gold Bit
=======

I clearly need help building the very first gold-backed token as an example for commodity backed token rather than service backed, which many are. I plan to launch on the NEO platform and the idea is going to require several confirmations. Auditing a safe of gold is a very difficult task as it is. Large banking institutions have given up on the process entirely, so if we can do some form of failsafe facilitated by the App, we are taking a step in the right direction.

Here are pieces need work set it up:

GOLD HOLDERS
In order to have a decentralized gold-backed cryptocurrency there must first be people with gold. What if you could be rewarded for holding gold in your safe? Would would consider buying some and registering it with Goldbit in exchange for some Goldbit Coin (GBC)? 

There are many all over the place, hiding their gold in separate locations for safe keeping. But gaining nothing from owning the asset, which banks have managed to do by leveraging the value of their holdings to raise capital. 




Incoherant Steps Written Years Ago:
1) Coins are not created by miners, only when gold-backers confirm secure ownership, a goldbit admin increases the GoldBit supply and gives those GoldBits to the gold-backer to sell. The GoldBit supply must also decrease when GoldBits are redeemed from the backers.

2) Thus mining must be volentary so the GoldBit supply remains tied to the quantity of backed gold, but i expect backers will be more than willing to give up a cpu, not unlike banks regulate dollar exchanges.

3) This is more like a encrypted liquid presale of gold, thus mining companies and gold dealers make the best backers.
(Design with big gold holders in mind.)

4) To start 1 Gold Bit = 1 gram of gold, which is like $45. None of that portion of a cent garbage that makes crypto currencies look less credible than penny stocks.

5) Since this currency easily spendable, it is better than gold and thus will rise above the gold price just from market demand.

6) If a backer defects, first sells the GoldBits and then takes the money AND gold and runs, the people who bought the coins need to be protected, but I haven't figured out how yet.

Non-fiat crypto-currencies liberate the human race. People want to work for real money, not some central bangster paper slave scam. Whose with me?
