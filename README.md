Gold Bit
=======

I need help building the very first gold backed crypto currency. The second crypto commodity right behind weed.

This coin is going to a little different:

1) Coins are not created by miners, only when gold-backers confirm secure ownership, a goldbit admin increases the GoldBit supply and gives those GoldBits to the gold-backer to sell. The GoldBit supply must also decrease when GoldBits are redeemed from the backers.

2) Thus mining must be volentary so the GoldBit supply remains tied to the quantity of backed gold, but i expect backers will be more than willing to give up a cpu, not unlike banks regulate dollar exchanges.

3) This is more like a encrypted liquid presale of gold, thus mining companies and gold dealers make the best backers.
(Design with big gold holders in mind.)

4) To start 1 Gold Bit = 1 gram of gold, which is like $45. None of that portion of a cent garbage that makes crypto currencies look less credible than penny stocks.

5) Since this currency easily spendable, it is better than gold and thus will rise above the gold price just from market demand.

6) If a backer defects, first sells the GoldBits and then takes the money AND gold and runs, the people who bought the coins need to be protected, but I haven't figured out how yet.

Non-fiat crypto-currencies liberate the human race. People want to work for real money, not some central bangster paper slave scam. Whose with me?
